# Haidra 

We are the volunteer community organization behind the revolutionary [AI Horde](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde) project and the thriving ecosystem that surrounds it.

We embody the boundless potential of open collaboration and strive to create an inclusive and innovative space for all. Join us as we explore the infinite possibilities of the open commons and shape the future of AI together.

If you're looking for how to volunteer your GPU check out the [AI-Horde-Worker project](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/horde-worker-reGen).

If you're looking to contribute code, feel free to open a pull request on any of our projects. We do appreciate a collaborative spirit, so feel free to run by any ideas or plans you may have with the community on [our discord server](https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn), or open an issue on the relevant project to start a discussion.
